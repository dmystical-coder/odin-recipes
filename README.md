# odin-recipes

It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished. I will revisit it in the future to style it up with CSS.

## Some important skills I'd have demonstrated on completing this website

- HTML boilerplate `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Lists `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- Links and Images `<a>`, `<img>`
- Commit messages
- Command line basics, e.g `cd`, `ls`, `touch`, `mkdir`
- Git basics, e.g `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log`
